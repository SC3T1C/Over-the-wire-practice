# LEVEL2 TO LEVEL3

Target: The password for the next level is stored in a file called --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory.<br>

This is similar to level 1 and 2 using the cat command and the cat < since there are dashes(-).<br>

In this level we are introduced to spaces in filenames.<br>

So to access spaces in filenames with the cat command, we will be quoting the file name: "--spaces in this filename--".<br>

command:

cat < "--spaces in this filename"<br>

The password I found on my run is "MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx"<br>

Then log in to bandit 3 using the ssh command.
