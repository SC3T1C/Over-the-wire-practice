# LEVEL 5 TO LEVEL 6

Target: The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

human-readable<br>
1033 bytes in size<br>
not executable<br>

This case is similar to level 5 having a lot of files but this time, it has a lot of folders containing a lot files inside.<br>

If we check all the folders and all the files it will take a long time.<br>

So instead we will be using the find command to find the file with these components as given:

human-readable<br>
1033 bytes in size<br>
not executable<br>
